## Install

We haven't yet published this package on `npm` but you can install it directly from the GitHub repository.

[`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install):

```sh
npm install RebusFoundation/ink-engine
```

## Example

```js
const engine = require("ink-engine");
const path = require("path");

const epubPath = "path/to/epubfile.epub";

// This callback is called for every file in the publication, including those generated by the engine like the publication JSON file itself
async function extract(vfile, resource, metadata) {
  // do something with the vfile, e.g. upload to Google Storage
  // Then return the full url for the uploaded resource.
  return "uploaded/" + resource.url;
}

async function process (file) {
  const result = await engine(
    file,
    extract
  );
  // `result` is the publication metadata object. It conforms to the W3C wpub standard _for the most part.
  console.dir(result)
}

process(epubPath)
```


## API

### `engine(filepath, extractCallback[, options])`

Returns a `Promise` for a publication object that conforms (for the most part) to the [W3C Web Publication note](https://www.w3.org/TR/wpub/).

#### `extractCallback(vfile, resource, metadata)`

* `vfile`: a virtual file object generated by the [`vfile`](https://github.com/vfile/vfile) module.
* `resource`: a [Web Publication `LinkedResource` object](https://www.w3.org/TR/wpub/#app-linkedResource). 
* `metadata`: suitable for the `metadata` property when uploading to Google Storage.

#### `options`

* `options.sanitize` (default: `true`): whether the extracted files should be sanitized before handed over to the `extractCallback`. This removes all JS files and sanitises CSS, HTML, SVG and XHTML files.
* `options.cssPrefix` (default: `#ink-engine`): the selector prefix that should be used to sandbox the selectors in extracted CSS.

Markup is sanitized using [`dompurify`](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify). CSS is sanitized using an internal PostCSS module that filters out all unknown properties, prefixes all of the selectors with your chosen selector, and removes `position: fixed`. It also transforms `body` and `html` element selectors to `ink-body` and `ink-html` for additional rendering control.

### Generated `hast` JSON files

The engine also generates `hast` JSON files for all HTML and XHTML files. [`hast`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast) is an abstract syntax tree format used by the [`unified`](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified) collection of processing tools. These JSON files let clients skip the HTML parsing stage when rendering the publications as a part of a website. They also come embedded with a version of the publication object, a ToC in object form (if available) under the `data.book` and `data.toc` properties respectively. And the `LinkedResource` object for the current file is available under `data.resource`.

## TODO

- [ ] Broader format support in general
- [ ] [`warc`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_ARChive) support
- [ ] Figure out if and how paged media formats can be supported (PDF, CBZ, CBR)
- [ ] Figure out if and how time-based media formats can be supported (video, audio, podcasts, audiobooks)
- [ ] Support the W3C's proposed [Lightweight Packaging Format](https://www.w3.org/TR/lpf/)
- [ ] Make the publication object more compliant with the W3C Web Publications Manifest note.
